# Installation

After cloning this project...

In the project directory, you have to run:
```
$ npm install
```

## Usage

#### After the installation successfully ends, you can use the rest of this commands:

* Run the project locally with:
```
$ npm run start
```
or
```
$ yarn start
```
Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

* Run the Test command:
```
$ npm run test
```
or
```
$ yarn test
```
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

* Run the Eject command:
```
$ npm run eject
```
or
```
$ yarn eject
```
Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can’t go back!

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except eject will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use eject. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

### Final Comments

> *"This project was pretty interesting and challenging for me mostly because i made it in the fastest way I could in a very short time, getting a good result and acommplishing the objectives presented in the challenge and even more. I had to improvise in a few cases but never is a bad moment to learn something new, even when you are hurry :)" - Oliva, Benjamin*
